Candy, it's been really nice, but I've got to go
'Cause I can't be the part of your life you don't wanna know

...and I can't keep lying all the time
And I know you'll find a better man
They're all too easy to find
And I'll just go away somewhere and slowly lose my mind

Candy, they called you a baby, they called you a whore
And I can't see the light at the end for you anymore

...and I can't keep lying all the time
And I know you'll find a better man
They're all too easy to find
And I'll just go away somewhere and slowly lose my mind

Candy, I can't be the man they want me to be
Maybe it was only with you that I could be me

...and I can't keep lying all the time
And I know you'll find a better man
They're all too easy to find
And I'll just go away somewhere and slowly lose my mind
