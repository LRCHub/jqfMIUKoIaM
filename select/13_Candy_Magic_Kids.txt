In the corner of my eyes I see her
In the middle of the night I hear her name
Candy
For a moment in time she lingers
On the tip of my tongue it melts away
La la

It's quiet now, I almost hear the sounds
I want to is that your heart beating through

There's no candy is sweeter than my baby, she turns to me and says
"There's no candy is sweeter than my baby", she turns to me and says
Ahh, ahh...

On her way to the summer driving
We had a laugh with the camera on my face
How the screen had her lips so glowing
Wondering how they never lose their taste

Then i don't need a polaroid to see
That evening the way I smile back at you

There's no candy is sweeter than my baby, she turns to me and says
"There's no candy is sweeter than my baby", she turns to me and says
Ahh, ahh...
