My girl's like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me right off of my feet
She's so fine as can be
I know this girl is meant for me

Candy girl, you are my world
You look so sweet, you're my special treat
Candy girl, all I want to say
When you're with me you brighten up my day

All I know when I'm with you
You make me feel so good through and through
The way you walk and the way you talk
You always look so good, you make me forget my thoughts

Do you really love me? Do you really love me?
Don't you really care? Don't you really care?
Do you really need me? Do you really need me?
And will you always be there?
Every night and every day, I'm always thinking of you
In every way, all I know when I'm with you
You make me feel so good through and through

Candy girl, you are my world, you're everything
You're everything, you're everything to me
Candy girl, all I want to say
I need your love each and everyday

Hey fellas, what? Check out Mike and Bobbie's ladies, ooh-wee
And we'll check out Rikki and Ralph, ooh
What about Ronnie's? She's bad
She's bad, I know she's bad

She walks so fast, she looks so sweet
She makes my heart actually skip a beat
My girl's the best and that's no lie
She tells me that I'm her only guy

That might be true but my girl's a joy
She don't play around, she's right to the point
My girl's like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me right off of my feet

Oh Candy, your love's so sweet
Oh Candy, my special treat

Candy, you're my candy
Candy girl, Candy
Candy, you're my candy
Candy girl, Candy

Candy girl, you are my world
I need your love each and every day
Candy girl, all I want to say, you're everything
You're everything, you're everything to me
Candy girl, you are my world
I need your love each and every day
Candy girl, I need it, need it
Need it, need it, need it every day
Candy girl
