I'm makin'
Candy and curry and
A friend in the mirror
I am seeing things much clearer
Than before

I am wishin' I hadn't taken you for granted
I am needing you
More than ever
That's for sure

I'm pickin'
Little purple violets from
Out in the side yard
I am learning wildflower
Recipes
I am practicing sun salutations
I am askin' for
Right direction
On my knees

I'm spending
Nearly every moment now
All by my lonesome
It is proving very difficult to do
I am hearing many voices so convincing
I am listening
I am wondering
Which are true?
